# ðŸš€ Manual Deployment to Google Cloud Run

## Since Docker/gcloud CLI are having issues, here's how to deploy manually:

### Method 1: Use Google Cloud Console (Web Interface)

1. **Create a ZIP file of your backend**:
   - Select all files in `malaysia-ai-backend` folder
   - Create ZIP file called `malaysia-ai-backend.zip`

2. **Go to Google Cloud Console**:
   - Visit: https://console.cloud.google.com/
   - Make sure project `bright-coyote-463315-q8` is selected

3. **Enable APIs**:
   - Go to APIs & Services > Library
   - Enable "Cloud Run API"
   - Enable "Cloud Build API"

4. **Deploy using Cloud Build**:
   - Go to Cloud Build > Triggers
   - Create a manual build
   - Upload your ZIP file
   - Use the Dockerfile we created

### Method 2: GitHub + Cloud Build (RECOMMENDED)

1. **Push to GitHub** (if not done):
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add FastAPI backend"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Connect GitHub to Cloud Build**:
   - Go to Cloud Build > Triggers
   - Click "Connect Repository"
   - Select GitHub and your repository
   - Create trigger for Cloud Run

3. **Automatic deployment** will happen on git push!
